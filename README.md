## Quick start

Several quick start options are available:

## Design Execution Standards

If you aren't sure how a feature should be constructed, we recommend checking out our [standards document](https://github.com/zurb/foundation-standards), which outlines every aspect of writing framework features, from sketch to content matrix.


## Versioning

For transparency into our work release cycle and in striving to maintain backward compatibility, our work is maintained under [the Semantic Versioning guidelines](http://semver.org/). Sometimes we screw up, but we'll adhere to those rules whenever possible.

See the Releases section of each project for change-logs for each release version. Release announcement posts contain summaries of the most noteworthy changes made in each release.
